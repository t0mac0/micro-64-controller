The goal of this project is a small and highly configurable N64 controller with support for the rumble pack, memory pack, macros and USB connection to transfer save games and update firmware on the controller.

To accomplish this requires some research into the N64 controller protocol. Another goal of this page is to document my take on the protocol and some parts that I've figured out.
